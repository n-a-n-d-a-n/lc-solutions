// Initially, you have a bank account balance of 100 dollars.
// You are given an integer purchaseAmount representing the amount you will spend on a purchase in dollars, in other words, its price.
// When making the purchase, first the purchaseAmount is rounded to the nearest multiple of 10. Let us call this value roundedAmount. Then, roundedAmount dollars are removed from your bank account.
// Return an integer denoting your final bank account balance after this purchase.
// Notes:
// 0 is considered to be a multiple of 10 in this problem.
// When rounding, 5 is rounded upward (5 is rounded to 10, 15 is rounded to 20, 25 to 30, and so on).
