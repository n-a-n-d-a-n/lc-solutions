// You are given an integer array order of length n and an integer array friends.
// order contains every integer from 1 to n exactly once, representing the IDs of the participants of a race in their finishing order.
// friends contains the IDs of your friends in the race sorted in strictly increasing order. Each ID in friends is guaranteed to appear in the order array.
// Return an array containing your friends' IDs in their finishing order.
